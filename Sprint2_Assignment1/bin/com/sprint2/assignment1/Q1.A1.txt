Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Ans:

	Static-> Those variables(also called instance variables) which is assigned by static data types are called
	Static variables.
	
	For example:
	 static String abc = "Ketan";
	 static int x = 23;
	 
	Here we can see--> 
	[static assigned first][String is data type]-[abc is variable name]-["Ketan" is value] ,
	[static assigned first][int is data type]-[x is variable name]-[23 is value]
	
	>More clarity with class-method:
	
	class Main{
	
		static String abc = "Ketan";
		static int x = 23;
		
		public static void main (String[] args){
		
			<those assigned static data types can be called inside directly> 
			
			for example:
					
			System,out.println(abc);   // will get the value- Ketan in console.
			System,out.println(x); 	// as same -  23
		
		}
	
	}
	
	
  Non-Static-> Those variables which is not assigned by static data types are called
	Non-Static variables.
	
	For example:
	 String abc = "Ketan";
	 int x = 23;
	 
	Here we can see--> 
	[String is data type]-[abc is variable name]-["Ketan" is value] ,
	[int is data type]-[x is variable name]-[23 is value]
	
	>More clarity with class-method:
	
	class Main{
	
		String abc = "Ketan";
		int x = 23;
		
		public static void main (String[] args){
		
			<those assigned non-static data types cannot be called inside directly> 
			< this must be create an object of class then it will be possible to call>
			for example:
			Main object = new Main();
			<after creating class-object we can call through object>
			
			System,out.println(object.abc);   // will get the value- Ketan in console.
			System,out.println(object.x); 	// as same -  23
		
		}
	
	}
