Q1) Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList

Ans:
	
				-----ArrayList-------			 								      ----LinkedList----
1) ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements.	     1) LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.

2) Manipulation with ArrayList is slow because it internally uses 	   	 2) Manipulation with LinkedList is faster than ArrayList because it uses a 
   an array.If any element is removed from the array, all the other		 doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory.
   elements are shifted in memory.
3) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements 		 3) LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements 
   List only.															 List and Deque interfaces.
4) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.					 4) LinkedList is better for manipulating data.

5) The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is 				 5) The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.
   contiguous.
6) Generally, when an ArrayList is initialized, a default  			   	 6) There is no case of default capacity in a LinkedList. In LinkedList,
   capacity of 10 is assigned to the ArrayList.							  an empty list is created when a LinkedList is initialized.
7) To be precise, an ArrayList is a resizable array.					 7) LinkedList implements the doubly linked list of the list interface.


Example:

class TestArrayLinked{    
 public static void main(String args[]){    
     
  List<String> al=new ArrayList<String>();//creating arraylist    
  al.add("Ravi");//adding object in arraylist    
  al.add("Vijay");    
  al.add("Ravi");    
  al.add("Ajay");    
    
  List<String> al2=new LinkedList<String>();//creating linkedlist    
  al2.add("James");//adding object in linkedlist    
  al2.add("Serena");    
  al2.add("Swati");    
  al2.add("Junaid");    
    
  System.out.println("arraylist: "+al);  
  System.out.println("linkedlist: "+al2);  
 }    
}    


Output:
  arraylist: [Ravi,Vijay,Ravi,Ajay]
  
  linkedlist: [James,Serena,Swati,Junaid]
