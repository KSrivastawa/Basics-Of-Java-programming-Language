Q1)  Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?  
        Explain with an example.

        
Ans: 
	Both expression gives you String object, but there is difference between them.
	 When you create String object using new() operator, it always create a new
	  object in heap memory.
	
	Example:
	
		=> With new operator String create the string in heap and put a copy in string
		 const pool so the result of hashcode is same in below case.
		 
		  String s1 = new String("Test");
	   String s2 = new String("Test");
	   System.out.println(s1.hashCode() + " "+ s2.hashCode() + " " + s1.equals(s2));
	
	But without using new operator its still giving the same hashcode.
	
	String s1 = new String("Test");
	    String s2 = "Test";
	    System.out.println(s1.hashCode() + " "+ s2.hashCode() + " " + s1.equals(s2));
