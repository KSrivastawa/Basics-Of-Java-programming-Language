Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?

Ans:

  ===Base===					  	=====Array====		   												===ArrayList====
	
 Dimensionality 			It can be single-dimensional or multidimensional 		  			It can only be single-dimensional 

 Traversing Elements 		For and for each generally is used for iterating over arrays 		Here iterator is used to traverse riverArrayList 
 
 Length 					length keyword can give the total size of the array.				size() method is used to compute the size of ArrayList.
 
 Size						It is static and of fixed length									It is dynamic and can be increased or decreased in size when required.
 
 Speed						It is faster as above we see it of fixed size						It is relatively slower because of its dynamic nature 
 
 Generics					They can not be added here hence type unsafe 						They can be added here hence makingArrayList type-safe. 
 
 Adding Elements 			Assignment operator only serves the purpose							Here a special method is used known as add() method
