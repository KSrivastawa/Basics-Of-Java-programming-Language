Q2) Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.

Ans:

=> Equals():
	The equals() is a method of lang.Object class, and it is used to compare two objects.
	To compare two objects that whether they are the same, it compares the values of both
	the object's attributes.
	By default, two objects will be the same only if stored in the same location.
	
	Syntax: 
		public boolean equals(Object obj)

	Returns:
		It returns the true if both the objects are the same, else returns false.
