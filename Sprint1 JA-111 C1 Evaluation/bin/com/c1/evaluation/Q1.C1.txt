Q1) Explain why Java is platform independent ?

Ans:
	Java is platform-independent because it is uses a virtual machine. The Java programming
	 language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes. Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent.
	  The virtual machine takes care of the differences between the bytecodes for the different 
	  platforms. 
	
	There are two phases are involved in java applications execution:
	1. Compilation phase
	2. Execution phase
	
	-This java compiler comes with the JDK software.
	-This java bytecodes is platform-independent, which means it can run on the window, Mac, Linux,
	or any Operating system that has JRE(Java Runtime Environment).
	-This JRE has a software component called JVM(Java Virtual Machine), this JVM takes our java byte-code 
	and translates it to the native code for the underlying OS.
