Q3) Change this block of code according to the given instruction and explain the output?
	
	public class Demo {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 64;
		int b = 70;
		byte c = a+b;//typecast (a+b) to byte
		System.out.println(c){
		}
	}
	Note: You need to typecast (a+b) to byte
	
	
Ans:
	Above class Demo will get compilation error,
	
	-Because in type casting we cannot direct assigned values without looking it's values;
	for example: byte have 1 byte and int have 4 byte so we cannot catch the value simply, 
	we have follow some rules of type casting which is described in the types.
	
	1. Implicit = The process of converting from lower data type to higher data type.
	for example: 
		byte a = 10;
		int b = a;
		System.out.println(b);
		
	2. Explicit = The process of converting from higher data type to lower data type.
	here is some pattern: P a = (Q)b;
						  (Q)-> Cast operator.	
	for example:
	int a = 10;
	byte b = (byte)a;
	System.out.println(b)
	
	As per changed according to question asked by:
	
	public class Demo {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 64;
		int b = 70;
		int c = a+b;
		byte d = (byte)c;
		System.out.println(d);
		
		}
	}
	
	status: No compilation error.
